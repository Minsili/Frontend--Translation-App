# React + Vite
# CSS
# Fornt-End Development

A simple template of a translation app done with React JS + Vite, and CSS. I created this react app for my end of year project(2023/2024) at IAI Cameroon. The template is responsive, which will give a dynamic experience to the end users while using the app.
